## What is True Adaptive Music?

TrueAdaptiveMusic adds a whole new dimension to Minecraft's music system! Instead of tracks being randomly played and loosely grouped together, they can now be played in specific situations. Music can either be triggered to play [while a certain in-game condition is met](./Music%20Packs/Predicates.md) or [on specific in-game events](./Music%20Packs/Events.md). You can even bring along any audio files you want to play! How is this all managed? Something called [Music Packs](./Music%20Packs/Music%20Pack%20Structure.md)! Music Packs (similar to resource and data packs) contain all of the logic that determines when music should play, and any new audio you want to bring into the game. These packs can then be shared with other users so they can jam along!

If you have any issues/suggestions for this doc or the mod itself, please create an issue ticket in the Github linked above.
